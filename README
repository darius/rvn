DESCRIPTION
       rvn is revision control for single files, written in bash, using diffu‐
       tils.

       It is very alpha and probably shouldn't be used. On the other hand,  it
       does seem to work.

       Revisions are numbered sequentially, starting with 0.

OPTIONS
       d, diff <file> [revision]

	   diff of file with revision. default revision: head

       h, help

	   help

       i, ci, checkin <file> [commit message]

	   commit changes to file with commit message.

       l, log <file> [revision]

	   show a log of (specific) revisions and commit messages.

       o, co, checkout <file> [revision]

	   checkout revision to file.revision. default revision: head

ENVIRONMENT
       rvn checks some environment variables:

       RVN_PRE
	   Override prefix for revision file.

       RVN_EXT
	   Override file extension for revision file.

FILES
       By  default,  for  file, rvn maintains .rvn/file.rvn in the same direc‐
       tory. File name and location can be configured with  environment  vari‐
       ables. rvn works with this file, which is itself in the form of a shell
       script that can be edited by hand, or executed with  bash  to  recreate
       any revision of the original file.

       Revision  files	consist mostly of calls to patch, and should be pretty
       easy to edit by hand.

EXAMPLES
       get started:
	   echo hello world > file
	   # generate initial commit
	   rvn i file my first commit
	   echo goodnight >> file
	   # diff with head
	   rvn d file
	   # another commit
	   rvn i file yay, committing again
	   # check the log
	   rvn l file

       Get revision of a file directly from a revision file:
	   bash file.rvn outfile [revision]

       Get a repository:
	   wget file.rvn
	   bash file.rvn file
	   mkdir .rvn
	   mv file.rvn .rvn
	   rvn l file

BUGS
       Too many to list.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       Doesn't implement locking or anything.
